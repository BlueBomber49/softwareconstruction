# Chess Game - Getting Started

üìÅ [Starter code](starter-code)

Complete the following steps to set up your project for this phase.

1. Copy the [ChessGameTests](starter-code/passoff/chess/ChessGameTests.java) file to your project's `shared/src/test/java/passoff/chess` directory.
1. **Optional**: If you want to implement castling and en passant for extra credit then you also need to copy the [chessExtraCredit](starter-code/passoff/chess/extracredit/) directory to your project's `shared/src/test/java/passoff/chess` directory. Do not copy this directory if you do not successfully implement the tests.
